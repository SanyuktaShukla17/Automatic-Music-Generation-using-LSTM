# Automatic-Music-Generation-using-LSTM
The Automatic Music Generation is a process of composing a short piece of music with minimum human intervention.
In this project, we will be creating an Automatic Music Generation model using LSTM. We will fetch notes from all music files which will then be fed into the model for prediction. Then finally we will create a MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) file using these predicted notes.
Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) is a type of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) that solves some scenarios where RNN failed. LSTM solves Long-Term dependency problem of RNN i.e. RNN networks store data of previous output in a memory for a very short period of time.
Unlike standard RNNs, LSTM has the ability to learn long-term dependencies. This is because LSTM introduces the concept of cells, which can remember information for lengthy periods of time. In addition, LSTM networks are well-suited to classification and prediction tasks
